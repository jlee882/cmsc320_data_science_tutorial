    "Bike share programs are a type of shared public transporatation system that is considered to be eco-friendly and sustainable. Typically these systems work by allowing people to rent bikes at a station, travel to their destination, and return the bike to another station. Such bike programs are frequently implemented in more densly populated areas such as cities, and have been relatively successful. Majority of revenue is from bike users and the the length of time they borrow a bike. This leads to the question: **what factors influences the number of bike trips in bike ahre systems?** Knowing this can allow us to see what business strategies can be used to optimize the conditions in which people use bike share programs and potentially incentivize people to use these more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, our goal is to create a walkthrough of the data science lifecycle and show how data science tools and techniques can be used to answer this particular question.\n"

    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle and is a dataset on a bike share program in San Francisco bay area. It contains 2 years of anonymized bike trip data from August 2013 to August 2015. In total, there are 4 tables: station, status, trip, and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Station has a total of 70 rows and 7 columns. This consists of data that represent stations where users can borrow and return bikes. Status has a total of 71,984,434 rows and 4 columns. This consists of minute by minute data about the number of bikes and docks avaliable at each station. Due to the sheer size of this table, we chose to not include any data contained in this table due to limits in computing power. Trip has a total of 669,959 rows and 11 columns. This consists of individual bike trip data. Weather has a total of 3665 rows and 24 columns. It consists of data about the weather on a particular day for specific zipcodes.\n",

Our data from Kaggle includes a zip file that we unzipped locally, which contains a sqlite version of the data and csv version of the data. Below, we decided to import our data sqlite file, however, we can also just read the csv files with `<dataframe> = pd.read_csv(<file path>)` for all csv files.\n",

The max being 287,840 minutes imply there is at least one outlier. With 75% of our bike trip duration data to be around 12.5 minutes or less, yet our mean is greater than 12.5 means our data is very skewed. Thus we can attempt to plot the distribution of the biking times to be at most 1 hours to better understand duration trends without the interference of outliers."
